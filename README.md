# Ragevolt

**Ragevolt** is a cutting-edge project focused on creating ultra-realistic mini PC simulations. We don’t just simulate hardware — we bring the *essence* of high-performance computing into a virtual, customizable, and lightweight environment.

## Our Flagship Model: RAGEVOLT R1

The **RAGEVOLT R1** is our first masterpiece, packing a simulated **GeForce RTX 5090 GPU** — yeah, the beast itself. This model delivers top-tier graphical power in a mini PC simulation that pushes the limits of what virtual hardware can do.

### Key Features

- **Next-Gen GPU/CPU Simulation:** Experience the raw power of the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 9950X simulated to run the most demanding graphical tasks.
- **Modular and Customizable:** Tweak your virtual hardware components to fit your exact needs.
- **Efficient Resource Usage:** Designed to run smoothly even on mid-range host systems, no need for a supercomputer IRL.

## Why Ragevolt?

We’re not just another emulator or simulator. Ragevolt is built from the ground up with modern simulation techniques, focusing on precision and flexibility. Whether you're a developer wanting to test hardware drivers or a gamer craving the ultimate PC simulation experience, Ragevolt is the way to go.
